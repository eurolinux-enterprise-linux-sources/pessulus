TODO
====

Future:
  * make the strings consistent
  * add more useful lockdown settings
  * keep the safe protocols that were once enabled somewhere in gconf so they
    are easy to reenable (?)

Problems waiting for a solution in another module:
  * why doesn't gconf immediately pick up the mandatory settings?
  * add --help, etc. in main.py
    => waiting for GOption wrapping in pygtk because we want the GTK+ option
       group
  * workaround in disabledapplets.py
    => waiting for bonobo_server_info_prop_lookup () to be wrapped in
       gnome-python
  * ugly workaround in disabledapplets.py
    => waiting for g_get_language_names () to be wrapped in pygtk
  * ugly workaround in lockdownappliergconf.py
    => waiting for gconf_engine_get_entry() to be wrapped in gnome-python
